# CRuby Source Code Dictionary

[![CRuby-Source-Code-Dictionary](https://github.com/ccmywish/CRuby-Source-Code-Dictionary/workflows/Test-Dict/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ccmywish/CRuby-Source-Code-Dictionary/actions/workflows/test.yml)

CRuby source code names explained using [cr: the Cryptic Resolver](https://github.com/cryptic-resolver/cr.rb). Please refer to its README to see the dictionary's layout and format.

<br>

This repo is a transformation to cryptic resolver dictionaries from [ruby's official doc](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/master/doc/contributing/glossary.md) (Moved from the former project: [@tenderlove's ruby glossary](https://github.com/tenderlove/ruby-glossary)).

I will keep track of the upstream to keep it up to date. Welcome contributions!
