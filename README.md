# Ruby Source Code Dictionary

My idea for knowledge management for C/C++ code base, is to record every abbreviation with its expansion. I'm glad to see that someone's effort is a very good example of [cr.rb](https://github.com/cryptic-resolver/cr.rb) target usage.

This repo is a transformation to cryptic resolver dictionaries from https://github.com/tenderlove/ruby-glossary
